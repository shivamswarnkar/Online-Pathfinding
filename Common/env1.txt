%	Note that "%" is a comment character (the rest of line is ignored)
%	We are basically reading several sequences of numbers,
%			one sequence per line.
%		Labels like "epsilon", "start", etc, will be ignored.
%		Also, commas (",") and colons (":") are ignored.
%		The order of the first 6 sequences of numbers are fixed:
%
%	For simplicity, there is one bounding box B0 
%		and all other polygons are contained inside B0.
%		REMARKS: when polygons nest inside each other, alternate
%		levels must change their CW or CCW orientation.
%
%	The structure of environment input files are as follows:
%
%	1.	radius:  r		% radius of robot
%	2.	epsilon: eps 		% small positive number
%	3.	bX:     x x' x'' x'''	%  (bX, bY) is the bounding box
%	4.	bY:     y y' y'' y'''	% 	with vertices in CW order
%	5.	start:  x1 y1		% start configuration
%	6.	goal:   x2 y2		% goal configuration
%
%	7.	p1X:    x x' x'' x'''	%  (p1X, p1Y) is a polygon
%	8.	p1Y:    y y' y'' y'''	% 	with vertices in CCW order
%	9.	p2X:    x x' x'' x'''	%  (p2X, p2Y) is a polygon
%	10.	p2Y:    y y' y'' y'''	% 	with vertices in CCW order
%	...	...			%  ... as many polygons as needed
